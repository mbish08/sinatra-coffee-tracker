This is my Coffee Tracking App.  It allows a user to create an account and once inside of their account, they can add coffees and ratings to their lists.  I created this as I like to try new coffees but I have a hard time keeping track of which ones I would like to order again.  

To use, clone repo from Github and run 'shotgun' in your terminal
